Applications
=================

Economics
-----------------
Many economic theories depend on analyzing the change in specified functions, often using derivatives. Using ``GradDog``, a user could easily evaluate the rate of change of, 
for example, the predicted change in supply or demand for an object in a given number of years.


Education 
-----------------
The tools implemented in the ``tools`` module are aimed at students in a Calc 1 course. 
Educators could use AD packages like ``GradDog`` to help their students practice these introductory calculus skills.


Physics
-------------
Many physical systems are described by second-order differential equations. ``GradDog`` allows users to easily calculate first and second order derivatives for scalar functions.
A user could calculate the expected acceleration of an object given its position as a function of time, for example.
