Further Extensions
===========================================


Higher-Order Derivatives
------------------------------
The Hessian enables us to calculate second-order derivatives for functions with vector inputs and scalar outputs. However, this project could be extended to include derivatives beyond the second-order. 


Analytic Derivatives
------------------------
This package could also be expanded to return the functional form of the derivative of a function rather than its value at given points.
