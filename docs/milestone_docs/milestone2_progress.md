# Milestone 2b - Progress
### 1. Division of Tasks:
- Write function.py module (includes `Function` base class, and other elementary function subclasses). (**Seeam & Max**)
- Write test suite for function.py. (**Seeam & Max**)
- Write AD module, GradDog.py, which combines all elementry function values and derivatives via forward mode of automatic differentiation. (**Ivan & Peyton**)
- Write test suit for AD package. (**Ivan & Peyton**)
- Write PaintGraph.py for generating AD trace tables and graphs. (**TBD**)

### 2. Accomplishments: 
- All met on zoom to add more examples and talked about concrete details to revise M1B.
- Max wrote functions.py with a function base class that works for polynomials.
- Discussed potential extensions for our AD project, such as dual numbers and optimization.
